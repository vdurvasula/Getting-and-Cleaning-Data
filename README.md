# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data

Introduction 
------------------ 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This project includes following deliverables - 

1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 

Getting Started 
----------------- 
Make sure to download the .zip file from the UCI project website. Create a sub-folder "week4_Project" under the working directory. Unzip the downloaded file in the newly created sub-folder. For more details about the data sets and variables, refer to the code book markdown document (codebook.md) 

Running Scripts 
---------------- 
1. Download the script file `run_analysis.r` from the repository. 
2. Execute the script 
``` // run script 
source('~/run_analysis.r') 
``` 
3. Tidy data set "Tidy_UCI_data_set.csv" will be written to the working directory
